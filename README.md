# RaspberryPiCam

Run receiver on a linux machine and sender on a raspberry pi with camera module V2; You can do this with SSH if both are connected to the same network

Settings that may improve performance is changing the Codec of H.264 level of encoding in the sender.

Make SURE you're running on a 5ghz hotspot without data to get maximum performance
